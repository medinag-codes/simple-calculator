# My Simple Calculator
This project was a challenge to make a simple calculator. I wanted to create something that looked like a calculator you might use everyday and included all the typical operators we use on a regular basis.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used HTML anD CSS to design and build out the look of the calculator, including the buttons and the input display to show the results. I used Javascript to manipulate the DOM and add behavior to the buttons to be able to perform the calculations and diplay the correct answer. 

## Lessons Learned:

This was one of my first projects using Javascript and manipulating the DOM to add behavior, so that was pretty cool. I was also excited to add a hover detail that will highlight the button you hover over it and then even more when you click it.
